# Theervu-Kural

**Theervu Kural** (திÉர்வு குரல்) is a web-based portal that allows citizens to directly raise public complaints (like water supply issues, garbage problems, broken infrastructure) to their local **Panchayat Office**. It aims to improve local governance and transparency by enabling easy complaint tracking, worker assignment, and resolution management through a single platform.



Project Overview

In many rural and semi-urban communities, public issues often go unreported or unresolved due to a lack of communication between citizens and governing bodies. **Theervu Kural** solves this by offering:

- A direct communication bridge between **people and panchayat offices**
- A **login system** for both citizens and panchayat officers
- **Location tracking** through Google Maps integration
- **Voice complaint support** for accessibility
- Real-time **task assignment and tracking** of resolution status

   Features

-  **User Registration & Login** (Public & Panchayat roles)
-  **Raise Complaints** with title, description, and optional voice input
-  **Google Maps Integration** for accurate issue location
-  **Voice-to-Text Support** using Web Speech API
-  **Assign Issues to Workers** by Panchayat Admins
-  **Complaint Dashboard**: View all issues (open, resolved, in-progress)
-  **Status Tracking**: Keep users updated on complaint resolution
